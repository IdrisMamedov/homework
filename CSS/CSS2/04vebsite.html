        <h2>Breaking Bad</h2>
        <p>White is a skilled chemist who co-founded a technology firm before he accepted a buy-out from his partners.
            While his partners became wealthy, Walter became a high school chemistry teacher in Albuquerque, barely
            making ends meet with his family: his wife Skyler (Anna Gunn) and son Walter Jr. (RJ Mitte). At the start of
            the series, the day after his 50th birthday, White is diagnosed with Stage III lung cancer. After this
            discovery, White decides to manufacture and sell methamphetamine with a former student, Jesse Pinkman (Aaron
            Paul), to ensure his family's financial security after his death. Due to his expertise, White's "blue meth"
            is purer than any other on the market, and he is pulled deeper into the illicit drug trade.</p>

        <h2>Season 1</h2>
        <p>On his 50th birthday, during his surprise party, Walt watches a news report about Hank arresting
            methamphetamine dealers. Walt is impressed by the monetary returns from the meth operation, and Hank offers
            to take him as a ride-along to a DEA bust. The next day, Walt faints at the car wash and is taken to a
            hospital; there, he is told he has inoperable lung cancer and will likely die within the next two years.
            During the ride-along, Hank busts a crystal meth lab, taking cook Emilio Koyama (John Koyama) into custody.
            Walt sees Emilio's partner fleeing the scene, and realizes it is one of his former students, Jesse Pinkman
            (Aaron Paul). Looking to secure his family's well-being by producing and selling meth, Walt tracks Jesse
            down and blackmails him into selling the meth that Walter will cook. Walt gives Jesse his life savings to
            buy an RV that they can use as a rolling meth lab.</p>
